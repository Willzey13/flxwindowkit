/**
 * This code allows for dynamically changing the border color of a window. It provides a simple and efficient method 
 * to modify the appearance of a window's border using Haxe. The code is designed to be used in Haxe projects and 
 * integrates seamlessly with HaxePunk or other frameworks that support window manipulation.
 *
 * This specific implementation is part of a larger library that I, Willzey, created in 2024. It is an innovative 
 * approach to customizing window elements, especially focusing on updating or modifying the window's border color 
 * based on specific user input or system events.
 *
 * By utilizing this method, you gain the ability to visually enhance your application's window, making it more 
 * interactive and visually appealing to end users. The logic behind this method ensures efficient performance while 
 * allowing for easy customization. The border color change is seamless and can be applied instantly to create 
 * dynamic effects within your application.
 *
 * Please note that this code is protected by copyright law. By using or distributing this code, you acknowledge 
 * that it is the intellectual property of Willzey. Any form of redistribution or modification of this code requires
